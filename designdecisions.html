            <p>
                In the upcoming walkthrough video, I will illustrate the application of the PARC principles, which are fundamental in effective visual design. These principles include proximity, alignment, repetition, and contrast, each playing a vital role in arranging elements, positioning them intentionally, creating a consistent design, and drawing attention to specific components. Their successful implementation contributes to a cohesive and visually engaging user experience (Henderson, 1999).

            <p>
                In upcoming video, I will also delve into the application of Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) based instructional strategies. These strategies include addressing issues related to split-attention, redundancy, and interactivity. By understanding how to minimize split-attention by presenting information effectively, reduce redundancy by selecting the most suitable modality for learning, and enhance engagement through interactivity, we can optimize the learning experience by minimizing cognitive load and enhancing comprehension (Cooper, 1998).

            <h2 id="designing-for-tablets">Designing For Tablets</h2>
            <p>
                According to a study by Radesky (2020), a significant proportion of young children, up to 75%, have their own tablets, and this percentage tends to increase as they grow older. Additionally, a report by Precise TV (2023) indicates that 25% of children use tablets for Video On Demand, 39% for watching YouTube, and 30% for playing games. The only devices that recorded higher usage were Connected TVs and Game Consoles. Consequently, this prototype has been designed specifically for tablet screens.

            <h2 id="the-prototype">The Prototype</h2>
            <p>
                This is an early, simplified version of PracticeQuest, focusing on the user journey of a student completing a daily quest. In this prototype, only one scale is demonstrated and it showcases just one type of question. The prototype includes low-to-medium fidelity wireframes, meaning that the final colours, images, and content are still under development. Nevertheless, the layout and placement of elements adhere to the intended design. Some elements have been coloured to differentiate between positive  and negative feedback or to draw attention to changes from the previous view.

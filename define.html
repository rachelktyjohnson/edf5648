            <p>
                The Define stage serves as the point where all our efforts in the preceding Empathise stage converge (Dam, 2022). In this stage, we've gathered, cleaned, and analysed the collected data. Our conclusions, refined through discussions with students, now guide us in gaining a more precise understanding of the fundamental issues we face.

            <p>
                The lack of explicit guidance on what to practice and how to do so correctly not only leaves students navigating their musical journey with uncertainty but also erodes their motivation, setting in motion a discouraging cycle of reduced practice, diminished progress, and further declining enthusiasm.
            </p>
            <p>
                The common directive to "go practice" falls short of producing meaningful results and can potentially create negative associations with music practice, leading to a less enjoyable experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Students who haven't dedicated much time to practice often shine in the classroom when guided by their teacher. The presence of a guiding figure is instrumental in keeping them motivated and on track in their musical journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                While some guardians may have the capacity to assist with practice at home, it's important to avoid assuming this is universally applicable. Many guardians, juggling busy schedules and often lacking musical expertise, face challenges in providing effective practice guidance due to limited time and mismatched instructional resources.
            </p>
            <h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
            <p>
                To develop a comprehensive practice support system that offers clear and engaging guidance for students during home practice sessions without the need for a guardian. This system will not only prompt daily guided practice but also enhance their motivation using gamification, ensuring a more enjoyable and fulfilling musical learning experience while away from the school.

                This website serves as the repository for the journey of exploration, research, and the development of an instructional design known as PracticeQuest.            </p>
            <h2 id="context">Context</h2>
            <p>
                The context is our privately owned and operated music school, a venture my husband and I have nurtured as sole shareholders. This autonomy grants us the flexibility to explore innovative teaching and learning methods without the need for external approval. Our investments, be it in terms of finances or time, are bounded only by our personal capacities.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, our stakeholders range from students to teachers to guardians - roles that often include us as well. While we can experiment due to our ownership, we must conduct thorough research to ensure that this design effectively alleviates the challenges faced by our stakeholders. By adhering to the principles of the Design Thinking framework, our commitment remains steadfast in placing our stakeholders at the heart of this project.
            </p>

            <h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
            <p>
                The challenge at hand is one that resonates with anyone involved in private music education - be it a teacher, student, or guardian: the lack of practice. It's a familiar struggle for those who have worn any of these hats, despite its importance in the learning journey. Students often find practice daunting, guardians may not always have the means to enforce it, and teachers' influence wanes once the student leaves the school premises.

                Yet, it would be an oversimplification to merely frame the problem as such, for that would not do justice to the complexity of the issue. Visit the <a href="define.html">Define</a> page for insights into how we uncovered and defined the issue.
            </p>
            <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
            <p>
                This project builds upon prior research on the challenges surrounding music practice to offer a refined problem definition, innovative ideation of solutions, and the prototyping of the concept.
            </p>
            <p>
                PracticeQuest aims to elevate the practice experience for music education stakeholders, with a special focus on those facing difficulties with practice at our studio: students aged 5-12 years old, whose guardians often grapple with busy schedules or lack the musical expertise needed to assist them effectively.

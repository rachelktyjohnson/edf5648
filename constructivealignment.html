                In the quest to bridge the gap between the classroom and home practice, an effective pedagogical framework is paramount. Constructive Alignment is one such framework that holds promise for deciding on the content within PracticeQuest.

            <p>
                Constructivism is a theory of learning that emphasises the learner's active role in constructing their own knowledge (Biggs, 1996). When learning a musical instrument, students actively engage in the process of understanding musical concepts, mastering techniques, and interpreting compositions. They explore, experiment, and build their musical competence through practice and reflection, all of which are fundamental tenets of constructivist learning. Consequently, the nature of learning a musical instrument resonates with the constructivist philosophy, making it an ideal domain to apply Constructive Alignment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alignment is a critical component of effective education, as it ensures that students engage in activities that match the level of learning they aim to achieve. Furthermore, alignment guarantees that assessments measure their ability to demonstrate the desired learning outcomes (Biggs et al., 2022). In music education, where learners construct their musical knowledge, this alignment is paramount. It ensures that the learning experiences provided are in harmony with the goals and outcomes envisioned for students, promoting meaningful and targeted musical growth.
            </p>
            <p>
                This section will systematically explore the three components of Constructive Alignment to determine the content within PracticeQuest.

            <h2 id="intended-learning-outcomes">Intended Learning Outcomes</h2>
            <p>
                In music education, Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs) play a crucial role in guiding the teaching and learning process. They are clear, specific statements that define what students are expected to know, understand, or be able to do upon completing a learning activity or course (Biggs et al., 2022).
            </p>
            <p>
                The SOLO taxonomy is a valuable framework that can greatly enhance the quality of education by promoting deeper learning and critical thinking (Biggs et al., 2022). As Scott (2000) observed, students who grasp the importance of recognising relationships among various aspects of a problem tend to perform better, especially when compared to those who rely on single strategies or employ multiple strategies in isolation.
            </p>
            <p>
                SOLO serves as a versatile tool for crafting music education ILOs. Music encompasses a multifaceted landscape of concepts, from theory and technique to interpretation of compositions. Therefore, embracing SOLO can offer a pathway to identify and use music theory elements, and to understand the abstract relationships between them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below are examples of ILOs tailored to each stage of the SOLO Taxonomy, designed for two common learning pathways for early piano students.

                PracticeQuest aims to address the majority of these stages, although occasionally it may become overly abstract, necessitating the regular face-to-face lessons.
            </p>
            <h2 id="teaching-and-learning-activities">Teaching and Learning Activities</h2>
            <p>
                To implement Constructive Alignment effectively, it's crucial to understand that teaching and learning activities should be strategically designed to align with the intended learning outcomes. As emphasised in the literature (Biggs et al., 2022), these activities need to engage students actively, promote diversity and challenge, and offer opportunities for practicing and application.Furthermore, the activities should align with the specific learning outcomes and maintain a balance between challenge and achievability. Additionally, it's essential to incorporate authentic and real-world scenarios to motivate students and enhance their retention, coupled with providing timely feedback to aid their skill development.
            </p>

                With this understanding, the following tables will delve into the specific learning activities presented via PracticeQuest for the two pathways mentioned earlier.

            <h2 id="assessment-tasks">Assessment Tasks</h2>
            <p>
                Demonstrations of understanding can take many different forms, such as writing essays, solving problems, or giving presentations (Biggs et al., 2022). For music, this traditionally occurs via performances and a demonstration of music theory knowledge. Our approach for PracticeQuest draws inspiration from both formative and summative assessments, strategically tailored to align with the ILOs. The following design decisions for our assessment tasks take inspiration from Larson and Lockee (2014) and Biggs et al. (2022).
            </p>
            <p>
                Formative assessments play a pivotal role in students' daily at-home practice, offered through engaging quizzes and interactive exercises. These ongoing evaluations provide students with timely and informative feedback, enabling them to reflect on their progress, recognise areas in need of improvement, and fine-tune their practice routines. Such assessments not only inform students of their current standing but also serve as self-assessment tools that foster a sense of autonomy and responsibility in their learning journey. Self assessment can help students to: Develop a better understanding of their own strengths and weaknesses, identify strategies for improving their performance, developing their reflection skills, and encourages students to take ownership of their learning (Panadero et al., 2016)
            </p>
            <p>
                When students return to the traditional classroom setting, they face summative assessments that mark the culmination of their efforts from the week of self-guided practice. These assessments serve as a measure of their overall growth and proficiency.
            </p>
            <p>
                A range of assessment methods will be used to diversify the student's experience with PracticeQuest, encompassing various quiz formats, interactive content, and state-of-the-art AI-powered music practice apps. Research by Chen (2020) and Wang (2023) has explored AI-powered educational tools capable of offering real-time feedback during music practice. This highlights the potential for PracticeQuest to enhance assessment feedback with AI-powered features.

            <h3 id="gamification-in-prototype">Gamification in Prototype</h3>
            <p>
                One design issue pertains to the integration of more gamification elements within the prototype. The prototype could potentially incorporate additional gamification features, but time constraints posed a limitation. Moving forward, it will be crucial to explore how these elements can enhance user engagement.            </p>
            <h3 id="handholding-in-videos">Handholding in Videos</h3>
            <p>
                A design challenge revolves around finding the right balance in instructional videos, particularly when showcasing the fingers playing the keyboard. The concern is whether this level of guidance might inadvertently lead students to rely on memorisation rather than reading musical notes, posing questions about how much hand-holding is beneficial for effective learning.
            </p>
            <h3 id="extrinsic-vs-intrinsic-motivation">Extrinsic vs Intrinsic Motivation</h3>
            <p>
                Gamification's role in motivating students presents another design issue. While gamification elements can provide extrinsic motivation, the concern is whether they may overshadow intrinsic motivation, which is vital for fostering a genuine love for music. This issue delves into the delicate balance between extrinsic and intrinsic motivation and their impact on students' musical engagement. (Birch & Woodruff, 2017)

            <h3 id="scalability">Scalability</h3>
            <p>
                The way constructive alignment was used and the examples constructed may raise concerns about scalability. While the elements of constructive alignment can be applied consistently to scales, arpeggios, and technical exercises, the unlimited number of musical pieces poses challenges in terms of scalability. The issue questions the scalability of this approach beyond the initial stages of learning.
            </p>
            <h3 id="inclusivity-and-accessibility">Inclusivity and Accessibility</h3>
            <p>
                The design challenge of ensuring inclusivity and accessibility for a diverse range of students should be considered. How well does the platform accommodate learners with different learning needs, abilities, and preferences? Would this learning tool be inaccessible for students who do not have a device? Addressing this issue involves incorporating elements that support various learning styles, making music education accessible to a broader audience.

            <p>
                PracticeQuest was created for an academic assessment, yet its value goes beyond the confines of the academic world. It's not just a project; it's the embodiment of my long-standing aspiration to revolutionise music education. The rigor of this academic endeavour offered a unique opportunity to delve deep into the intricacies of effective learning design and align them with real-world application.

            <h3 id="aspirations-awakened">Aspirations Awakened</h3>
            <p>
                The idea of an innovative music education platform has been brewing in my mind for quite some time. However, without the academic grounding and this assessment's academic scrutiny, I may have been hasty in bringing it to life. This project illuminated the importance of holistic preparation and the significance of addressing every aspect, from pedagogical theory to the practicalities of implementation.

            <h3 id="theory-in-action">Theory in Action</h3>
            <p>
                PracticeQuest is the result of merging educational theories with real-world execution. Constructive alignment and cognitive load theory, among others, played a pivotal role in shaping this endeavour. It underscores that solid educational foundations can lay the groundwork for transformative teaching tools. This project signifies the potential of research-backed educational technology to create transformative and engaging learning environments, emphasising the need to bridge the gap between theory and practice for the betterment of education.

            <p>
                As I look back, it's evident that the development of PracticeQuest mirrored my own journey of growth and discovery. It reinforced the idea that education is a fluid, evolving landscape, and staying open to change and innovation is essential to keeping up with the ever-shifting needs of students and educators alike.

            <h3 id="future-prospects">Future Prospects</h3>
            <p>
                With the completion of this academic chapter, PracticeQuest stands as a beacon lighting the way to a future where music education can be not just instructive but also engaging and immersive. It epitomises not merely a project but a vision of how education might adapt and flourish in the digital age. The journey ahead is promising, and my commitment to it unwavering.

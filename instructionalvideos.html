            <h2 id="video-design-decisions">Video Design Decisions</h2>
            <h3 id="ctml-and-video-design">CTML and Video Design</h3>
            <p>
                The Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML) serves as the foundation for effective instructional video design (Fyfield et al., 2022). CTML principles such as coherence, segmenting, and learner control have proven to enhance the learning experience when it comes to instructional videos (Fyfield et al., 2022). In line with these principles, we've made deliberate design choices to create videos that align with effective learning strategies.
            </p>
            <h3 id="visuals-and-animations">Visuals and Animations</h3>
            <p>
                We acknowledge that visuals play a vital role in making videos engaging and informative (Fyfield et al., 2022). In our videos, we've utilised visuals when necessary, primarily to maintain clarity for our young target audience. Visuals are included to directly relate to the task at hand. The use of colour is done sparingly to ensure that focus is drawn correctly. This is luckily quite achievable as the piano itself is black and white.
            </p>
            <p>
                While not prominent in the examples, animations are planned to be integrated into the videos, specifically for conveying complex musical concepts like the circle of fifths and intervals.
            </p>
            <h3 id="interactivity-and-feedback">Interactivity and Feedback</h3>
            <p>
                Engaging learners is essential, and we've embraced the importance of interactivity as it can motivate students and activate their prior knowledge (Fyfield et al., 2022; Mayer et al., 2020). Our videos are designed with pauses to allow students to interact. For instance, in our interval videos, multiple-choice questions are presented during these breaks. Additionally, the platform provides real-time feedback to aid students in identifying and correcting their mistakes.
            </p>
            <h3 id="multimedia-use">Multimedia Use</h3>
            <p>
                We recognise that a blend of media elements like text, images, and audio can significantly enhance the learning experience (Noetel, 2020). In our videos, we've thoughtfully incorporated a mix of these elements while being mindful not to overwhelm students, as they also engage with their own pianos and sheet music.
            </p>
            <h3 id="video-length-and-segmentation">Video Length and Segmentation</h3>
            <p>
                Studies suggest that instructional videos are most effective when they are 6 minutes or less in length and segmented where possible (Henderson, 2023). Our videos are intentionally short to suit our young audience, some are as short as 30 seconds. Key sections are segmented, focusing on gradual learning, akin to the way we encourage students to approach new music - one bar at a time.
            </p>
            <h3 id="instructor-face-and-demeanor">Instructor Face and Demeanor</h3>
            <p>
                Decisions regarding the inclusion of an instructor's face are based on the learners' needs (Kizilcec et al., 2015). For these videos, the instructor's face is omitted to reduce distractions for young learners.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, research has indicated that the instructor's demeanour in videos can influence learners' motivation and mood (Horovitz & Mayer, 2021). Although these example videos do not show an instructor's face, they are designed to mimic a happy and motivated teacher to ensure a sense of familiarity and support for the student.
            </p>
            <h3 id="dynamic-drawing-and-first-person-perspective">Dynamic Drawing and First Person Perspective</h3>
            <p>
                Filming the video from a learner's perspective can help increase their sense of immersion and engagement (Mayer et al., 2020). To maintain student engagement and foster familiarity, our videos incorporate dynamic drawing and a first-person perspective. This approach ensures that students are focused on the visual changes on screen and the accompanying voice and sound.
            </p>
            <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                This structured approach to video design ensures that our content is
                both pedagogically effective and attuned to the specific learning
                requirements of our students.
